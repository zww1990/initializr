= Contributing to Spring Initializr

Spring Initializr is released under the Apache 2.0 license. If you would like to contribute
something, or simply want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.

== Code of Conduct
This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of
conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Using GitHub issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage question
please ask on https://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow] or join us on the
https://gitter.im/spring-io/initializr[Gitter channel].

== Sign the Contributor License Agreement
Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to
https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[sign the Contributor License Agreement].
Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main
repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an
author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and
given the ability to merge pull requests.


== Code Conventions and Housekeeping
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

* We use the https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat/[Spring JavaFormat] project
  to apply code formatting conventions. A plugin is available for Eclipse and IntelliJ
  IDEA. You can also format the code from the Maven build by running
  `./mvnw io.spring.javaformat:spring-javaformat-maven-plugin:apply`.
* The build includes checkstyle rules for many of our code conventions. Run
  `./mvnw validate` if you want to check you changes are compliant.
* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an
  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is
  for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files
  in the project)
* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more
  than cosmetic changes).
* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current `main` (or
  other target branch in the original project).
* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],
  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit
  message (where XXXX is the issue number).



== Working with the Code



=== Building from Source
Spring Initializer source can be build from the command line using
https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Apache Maven] on JDK 1.8 or above.
We include '`Maven Wrapper`' scripts (`./mvnw` or `mvnw.bat`) that you can run rather
than needing to install Maven locally.



==== Default Build
The project can be built from the root directory using the standard Maven command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean install
----
